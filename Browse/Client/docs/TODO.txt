Features:

			Worry about it later? I don't think that handling not encrypted Strings is great.. :D

Test all MAMEM trial tasks! -> Sofias Document

Furthermore:
- HTML5 Video Player support (replace tab bar with controlls and dim everything)
- Inkognito

- Https recognition and displaying of lock
- CSS Injection
- Right click and _own_ context menus (see JS Window Object)
	- (Javascript Popup Handling)

Additional ideas:
- Emulate each keyboard key pressed on keyboard and show text, already filled in input field, and show temporary search results etc. as they appear
- Button for form submit? Emulating 'Enter' doesn't always submit a form
	-> Advanced form handling? e.g. check if all required fields are filled

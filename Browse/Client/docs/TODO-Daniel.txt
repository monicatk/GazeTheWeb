### BUGS ###
	?

### EXTRA ###

%%% Find a way to observe changes in specific CSS style attributes, especially 'display' when set to none!
%%% see Twitter, posting tweets to other people!

Pause Tab Rendering / Script Execution
  - Useful during zooming at click emulation 
  	--> You can not really stop any script, but you might block the whole renderer thread :D (like JS dialogs do)

### REFINEMENT###

>>> Extend usage of MutationObserver
	[ ] Use observer to trigger updates in node visibility and to set overflow parents, remove those methods from DOM Objects

>>> DOM Node data update:
	[ ]	Read out values on direct callback in RenderProcessHandler without using MsgRouter on Browser Process
		See: https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/GeneralUsage.md#markdown-header-asynchronous-javascript-bindings

>>> Text Selection!
	- 	Create clipboard in Master: std::vector<std::string> 
		Clipboard might also contain pictures in the future

Other
[ ]	Copy childFixedId to C++ Tab in order to determine parenthood of fixed elements to other DOM objects

>>>	Overflow Elements:
	[X]	Don't scroll OEs if not visible!
		[ ]	Use edge of fixed element if OEs edge is partially covered by a fixed element

	[ ] Separate possible vertical and horizontal scrolling in Overflow objects and only execute scrolling in those given directions

	[ ] Scrolling buttons on OEs covering the whole page:
			[ ] Support "Scroll top" button on OEs covering the whole page?
			[ ] Automatic scrolling works, but Scroll Buttons not shown
	[ ] Do not update OE's contained nodes' rects, if OE not visible!
	[X]	FIXED overflow elements
	-	?? Remove overflowParent attribute from DOMObjects and do aquivalent visbility check for each child in OverflowElements
	[X]	Calculate partial Rects if partially hidden by OverflowElements
	[X]	Trigger childrens' Rect updates when scrolling happend
	- 	OE containing another OE, keep outer OE scrollable
		--> additional: scroll when looking outside at the edge of OE
	-	Don't scroll in x-direction if there are only e.g. 30px for hiding the scrollbar
		Example: Message list on Fb when clicking on message button in the topmost menu bar
		--> get scrollbar width and check scrollWidth - rect.width > scrollbar.width
	-	Visibility check if menu disappears again
		Example: Message list on Fb when clicking on message button in topmost menu bar

>>>	Fixed Elements
	[ ]	Cut-off rects if fixed element covers another DOM object
	-	Add z-index for layers of fixed elements
		Example: Facebook chat popup in the right corner in contrast to mainpage in the background, consisting partly of other fixed elements
	-	Better union of all child Rects (not simple bounding boxes)
		Example: Facebook chat windows on the top

>>>	Other:
	- 	Emulate Enter button and send Fb message within chat window
	- 	Find EVERY DOM node on its creation/appending to DOM (see GMail)
	-	Remove 0x IDs for nodes etc. in JS & use SeparateBy method in C++ (BrowserMsgRouter) to decode








### DEPRECATED TODO LIST ###

GMail Support:
	when login in:


		


VISIBILITY
[ ]	For each DOMNode: Not only save if fixed or not, save ID corresponding to fixed element's ID to check if DOMNode might be not visible because of other fixed elements in front of it
[X]	Updating visbility of DOMNodes when picture on Wikipedia is clicked and positioned in the page's center by using the fact that BoundingRects of all DOMNodes should be currently 0x0
	[ ] Detect Buttons on Wikipedias Image Viewer -- but how?
[ ]	Injecting input text doesn't work right now on Google?



__________________________________________________________
[Y] offscreen rendering ready?
	--> [ ] implement DOM relevant CEF methods
	--> [ ] update Javascript Code for all kinds of DOM nodes and their data
	--> [Y] get rid of scrollbars on webpages (take a look at prototype for a rough idea)

TOPIC: Update function for DOM Nodes (after page load finished, e.g. Popups)
	[?] Is there a callback when changes on web page are displayed >>after<< load ended? Update DOM Nodes using their ID?
	IDEA: Concentrate on dirtyRects (see Renderer::OnPaint) to get changed regions (implies possible changes in DOM nodes),
			(OR check if there are any new HTML IDs not corresponding to any DOM Node --> HTML IDs suck bc they usually aren't set)

_________

Get actual page size: see for example wikipidia.org, uni-koblenz.de
--> what if zooming is enabled? Times zoom factor sufficient?

_________





[ ] Test CSS injection

[ ] SCROLLING: set absolute coordinates of frame via JS?
[Y] SCROLLING: Set back Scrolling to (0, 0) on button click --> Javascript? Yes, sir. Atm only main frame
		--> [ ] Setting back scrollable areas within the document? (you would need some kind of button in a circle menu)

[ ] KILL EXCEPTIONS when closing by setting warning lvl to higher lvl

[ ] Remove text already filled in (aka 'placeholder') input fields after input happend (see fb.com before logging in)

MutationObserver use-cases:
	[ ] DOM nodes adds himself to list of nodes (future: induce C++ callback via JS when this happend)
	[ ] Set zoom asap (when body.style.zoom exists)
	[ ] document.documentElement.getClientBoundingRect().width/height observable?

[ ] TIMING DOM NODE UPDATE: Maybe append new DOM nodes to lists instead of complete recreation  

[Y] COLORING -> FAVICONS: Get icon url via JS, open with icon CefBrowser, render it, get main color

[ ] POP-UP HANDLING: Open new Tab instead of new Window, not belonging to our OSR window...

TOPIC: Copy & Paste of Strings: Predefined methods in CefFrame

NO LOAD END: endlessly scrollable pages like a Fb timeline 	
	--> do not trigger onLoadEnd callback
		--> you don't know when to update DOM node data 
			(e.g., mainly links may be contained)
			--> recognize those regions via Javascript? 
				or when scrolled to former end of page!

HIDDEN DOM NODES: Upon scrolling, DOM nodes can be hidden by other elements (may be solved in future approach)

WINDOW TITLES: Get window titles of each Tab and get String to Tab as caption --> there's a CEF callback for that!

MINOR STUFF:
	- Setting of canGoBack/Forward not with each OnLoadingStateChange call?
	- IPC_Container::SetIPCArgumentsValue
		    if (attr.GetArraySize() == 0)
    		{
        		// TODO: Unneccessary branch? Does v8Value->GetValue(0)->GetIntValue() work on non-arrays too? Test it!
       			 switch (attr.GetDatatype())
        	{ [...]


KNOWN BUGS:
[ ] .ico Favicons not shown in GUI, wrong encoding?
		ERROR: Received favicon width or height <= 0! url=http://www.tagesschau.de/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png
[Y] CefBrowser continues loading even though Tab was closed (see a playing video while closing Tab for example)


[ ] Stuff from Raphael
	[Y] Some pages do not load correctly (mamem.eu)
	[Y] Mediator: CanGoBack / CanGoForward  				
		--> Daniel says: For GUI button highlighting? There's a callback telling you if browser can go back/forward at this moment
				If Tab would have some bool attributes for that I could set them when this callback is received
				If there is any error taking place because of this, let me know :)
	[Y] Call SetURL of tab when new page starts loading
	[Y] Set Zoom (Global or for Tab?)
		--> Daniel says: A permanent zoom for each Tab/browser? Or for each website individualy? Or both? (all of them may be settings worth safing to a permanent file)
		[ ] No global zoom yet

DONE
[Y] Get rid of CefExpansion?
[Y] Try expanding CEF to work with multiple tabs
[Y] BrowserHost::CreateBrowser changeable? Better handling of concurrent browser creation when Tab is registered needed
	--> Nope. BrowserHost::CreateBrowserSync (returns CefRefPtr<CefBrowser>) and Tab* _pendingTab used, because Renderer starts extremely quickly after CefBrowser creation (before std::maps with target texture can be filled) -- works this way
[Y] Move DOMMapping to CefMediator
[Y] SCROLLING: Expand CefMediator to send scrolling commands to CEF


STUFF:
[+] Browser pointer or identificator? (in CefMediator's std::map)
	--> Depends, e.g. std::map _browsers in CefMediator, you look up a specific browser corresponding to a Tab an you can directly access it because of the pointer. Identificator would mean that you have to iterate over list of all browsers and compare identificators.
